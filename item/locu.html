<p>
  Locu's mission is better local data. That means a product that caters to restaurant owners as well as app developers, and a staff that includes both data scientists and visual designers. I created the identity system, designed the merchant dashboard, and coded on the application's front-end.

	I conceptualized a single template that adapts content to to websites, facebook widgets, mobile phones, and real-life printed menus, then worked closely with other front-end developers to make it happen. The system allows print-and-web-savvy designers to create a single design language for all media, and the end users - small business owners - can customize the design with simple options without worrying about the complexity of formatting in Word or hiring a webmaster.
