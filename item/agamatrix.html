<p class="h3">Mobile + Healthcare + Intern</p>

<p>There's plenty of buzz around mobile healthcare products. However, doing more than a digital pedometer is tough for a startup â€“ you need medical and legal expertise, and the patience and perseverance to wade through the existing beuracracies of the FDA, insurance companies, and the rest of the medical establishment. Agamatrix is positioned to do just that - they combine medical research, software development, manufacturing, and product design.</p>

<p>As a product design intern, I contributed to projects in every step of the product development process. As many products are not yet released, I'm only displaying a few excepts here.</p>
