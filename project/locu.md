Locu combines business tools, data science, and design. When I first met them, they'd set out to collect and organize all the small business data available.

My task was to reconcile the structured nature of the raw data with the messy and complicated needs of business owners. That meant pushing the limits of digital publishing while remaining compatible with old computers and friendly enough to win over businesses.

### Editing structured data

The data structure is pretty simple - Menu > Section > Subsection > Menu Item > Option Group > Option. However, the editor is probably competing with zero structure - most of Locu's users designed and edited their menus in Microsoft Word.

The average interface for editing structured data is a few levels deep. The first level is for viewing items. The second level is a popup window to edit those items. And for sub-information, like options, we go a level deeper. This works alright for one or two quick edits, but it's awful if you're trying to enter a menu.

The Locu interface addresses this in two ways. First off, the app uses machine learning and human-powered quality control to import existing menus.

More importantly, we flatten the interaction depth to zero and represent hierarchy with scale and design, just like in Word. Click on any text, you're editing it in place. Each edit doesn't need its own "Okay" button to confirm - there's one master save button.

### Design + Publish

Restaurants have to manage a mess of technology to actually get anything published. Their in-restaurant menu is a local Word doc or PDF. Updates to the web site require emailing a web master and either linking their print PDF or retyping it as HTML. And now they are expected to put it on Facebook, make it mobile-friendly, add an online-ordering system, and keep track of themselves on every new food/social app?

The design/publish workflow consolidates everything into one step - the save button. That's it.

### Branding and marketing

The name Locu stuck early on - it manages to be both unique and descriptive without feeling too goofy (the pitfall of countless internet startups) or too stodgy (the pitfall of many other business-to-business companies).

The identity system conveys a fresh, bright confidence.
