When I first met Locu, they had set out to collect and organize all the small business data available. My task was to reconcile the structured nature of the raw data with the messy and complicated needs of business owners. That meant pushing the limits of digital publishing while friendly enough to win over businesses.

### 1 - Editing structured data

Developers need data with structure: Menu > Section > Subsection > Menu Item > Option Group > Option. But most of Locu's users have been designing and editing their menus in Microsoft Word. 

<!-- This works alright for one or two quick edits, but it's awful if you're trying to enter a menu. -->

<!-- The Locu interface addresses this in two ways. First off, the app uses machine learning and human-powered quality control to import existing menus.
 -->

We flatten the interaction depth to zero and represent hierarchy with scale and design, just like in Word. Click on any text, you're editing it in place. Each edit doesn't need its own "Okay" button to confirm - there's one master save button.

### 2 - Design + Publish

Restaurants have to manage a mess of technology to actually get anything published. Their in-restaurant menu is a local Word doc or *PDF*. Updates to the web site require emailing a web master and either linking their print *PDF* or retyping it as *HTML*. And now they are expected to put it on Facebook, make it mobile-friendly, add an online-ordering system, and keep track of themselves on every new food/social app?

The design/publish workflow consolidates everything into one step - the save button. That's it.

### 3 - Branding guidelines

The name Locu stuck early on - it manages to be both unique and descriptive without feeling too goofy (the pitfall of countless internet startups) or too stodgy (the pitfall of many other business-to-business companies).

The identity system conveys a fresh, bright confidence.

10,000 restaurants use the tools. OpenTable, CitySearch, TimeOut and countless others use Locu data.
