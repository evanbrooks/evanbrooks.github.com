__1-3__ — A clear, unambiguous visual style with large type and oversized buttons. The system can accomodate additional warning messages as the legal and medical teams identify them, so app development works more smoothly with the risk management team.

__4-6__ — A concept app that teaches people recently diagnosed with diabetes how to identify the signs of high and low blood sugar.
