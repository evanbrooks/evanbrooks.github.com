### Rhode Island School of Design *Fall 2009 - Present*

### Product Designer at Locu *Fall 2010 - Spring 2012*

I met the Locu founding team members while they were students at MIT, and have worked closely with them creating publishing tools for small business owners. I helped to found the product design team, and I researched, designed, and did front-end development for the product. I also designed the brand, logo, and marketing materials.

I continued to work on projects and advise the company part-time while finishing my degree.

### UI/UX Design Intern at Agamatrix *June 2011 - April 2012*

AgaMatrix is a mobile health company that created the first iPhone-compatible glucose meters for people with diabetes.

I designed interfaces for the iPhone and for small lcd displays, as well as hardware device concepts and informational web sites.

I worked closely with people with diabetes, hardware and software engineers, medical and regulatory experts, and other designers. While I had planned for a summer internship, I ended up staying for 10 months as a member of the design team.
