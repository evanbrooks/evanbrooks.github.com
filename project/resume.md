### UI/UX Design Intern at Agamatrix *June 2011 – April 2012*

AgaMatrix is a mobile health company that created the first iPhone-compatible glucose meters for people with diabetes. I designed interfaces for the iPhone and for low-cost devices, as well as hardware concepts and promotional material.

I learned to work closely with people with diabetes, hardware and software engineers, medical and regulatory experts, and other designers. I started as a summer intern, then worked as a full-time member of the design team for several months following.
