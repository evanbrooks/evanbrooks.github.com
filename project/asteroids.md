The News Arcade is a very inconvenient way to read the paper. It pulls articles from the New York Times RSS feed, then lets the user interact with the articles in the style of the classic arcade game Asteroids. Large “section” asteroids split into smaller “article” asteroids when the user hits them.

When the user shoots an article astroid, they can choose to read the article, for which they gain a point, or ignore it for which they lose a point.
