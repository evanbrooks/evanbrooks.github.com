Clerestory is a journal for the arts. Every issue has a 7 inch by 5 inch cover that uses only black and white, but otherwise we reinvent the design and form every time.

As design editor, I planned each issue in conjunction with the rest of the editorial board.

### Spring 2011 issue

We decided to add music to the journal. With so many different types of media, this edition was in the form of a sleeve that contained large, loose-leaf artwork, a CD, and a smaller perfect-bound book of prose and poetry.
