The [deYoung Museum](http://deyoung.famsf.org/) is a world-class art museum with a split personality. They feature incredibly popular shows by well-known artists and designers, like Dale Chihuly and Chuck Close. “The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier,” featuring among other style icons Madonna's cone bra, was bustling with people throughout the exhibit's run.

By contrast, the reknowned collection of artifacts from Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific islands sits in dead silence the floor above. But art does not exist in isolation, it constantly appropriates from other artists and other cultures.

This proposed identity and campaign reemphasize the purpose of the art museum and the power of the curator to create meaning.

The building, designed by [Herzog and de Meuron](http://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index.html), features a gorgeous and striking copper skin. Shimmering in the sunlight when new, the copper fades and turns green over time, integrating the museum into the landscape of the park. Each panel has a unique surface, carefully shaped by its surroundings.

With this in mind, the mark abstracts the light hitting surface of the building. At the same time, it suggests the formation of a connection between two nodes.

	<h5>The website reflects the nature of change over time, as captured by the copper panels. It is a continuous timeline of the show currently featured. Also, it has the hours on the home page, which seems obvious but somehow isn't standard.</h5>

	<h5>A map / wayfinding app can do more than show facts about what's in front of you. It could lead the museumgoer into further, less familiar parts of the museum to help them make new discoveries.</h5>
