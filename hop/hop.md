The Shelburne Museum's Collection of Toys, Dolls, Dollhouses, and Automata is an incredible place. Located in Shelburne, Vermont, it's packed with the beautifully crafted playthings of past toymakers.

Unfortunately, it doesn't sounds like much fun. Especially to kids.

### Make × Play

The Hop! encourages active and imaginative play—celebrating the curiosity and created worlds that children make in their minds from the simplest toys. These ideas put the museum in line with the "Maker Movement." Do-it-yourself-ers of all ages are the modern-day toymakers, and Make Magazine and its associated [Makerfaires](http://makerfaire.com/) are full of enthusiasm, project ideas, and wonder at what other makers have made.

The proposed  __Make × Play__ festival brings together the stories, trust, and infrastructure of the museum with the relentless energy of a Makerfaire. It integrates and focuses the Shelburne's existing summer camps with the core identity. The name is both an exclamation, "Make Play!", and a mission statement, "Make by play."

### On the antique

The antique toys in the Hop's collection are beautiful pieces of craftsmanship - mechanical 'automata' surprised and delighted audiences with their lifelike movement. Simpler toys – sticks, balls, and dolls – were animated by children's own narratives. Modern, mass-produced toys have a built-in story from the movie or TV characters whose likenesses were licensed.
